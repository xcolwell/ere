

why are there lines in the big view?


BUGS:
- start focused on node closest to (0,0)
- click in zoom mode ... shouldn't allow



- use correct aspect ratio for recusive space
- do a simple slide tonight
- work on transition from graph to recursive tomorrow




This is the real shit.
Limited to depth 1,
but we have room for a master stencil on the top of everything.

must do infinite zoom tomorrow


[node, blob] of focus

at some point it's locked in

grow out master "peeking hole"
grow in the texture underneath












recusrive stencil buffer

[depth][id on depth]   [depth][id on depth]

for layer0, first block is current
for layer1, second block is current, first block is source

we recusrively stencil this way


use 4 bit depth, 8 bit id

24 bit stencil



rendering strategy --

render at most M
always render under the mouse
